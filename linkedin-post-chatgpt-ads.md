So ChatGPT has ads now.

Everyone's asking: how do I advertise on AI?

Here's what I'm thinking about:

Two big shifts are happening at once.

First, advertising. On Google, you search, you expect ads, you move on. That's the game. But on AI, you ask a question and you trust the answer. You want help, not ads. So the game changes. We're not fighting for attention anymore — we're fighting for trust. The real estate is what AI says about you.

Second, content. AWS and Microsoft are building marketplaces to pay for content to train AI. Your articles. Your insights. Your knowledge. All becoming trainable data. When that happens, creating content isn't just sharing ideas — it becomes proof of expertise. It becomes credentials.

Here's what connects these two: both are about giving your content to AI. One way, AI recommends you. The other way, AI learns from you.

Now here's the uncomfortable part: advertising assumes you need to convince someone. But AI doesn't convince — it answers. So what does advertising even mean when AI gives better answers than any ad could?

But honestly? This is a huge opportunity. New channel. New behavior. New format. First movers always win.

I'm watching closely. And I'm not waiting around to figure it out.
