So ChatGPT has ads now.

Everyone's asking: how do I advertise on AI?

But here's what I keep coming back to:

Advertising assumes you need to persuade someone. You interrupt, you grab attention, you convince.

But AI answers questions. That's its whole value. It gives you the best answer, not the best bid.

So here's the thought experiment: imagine a world where AI gives perfect answers. Every time. What's the value of advertising there? Probably zero.

We're asking the wrong question. The question isn't "how do I advertise on AI?"

The question is: "does advertising even make sense when AI already gives better answers than any ad could?"

That's the shift I'm thinking about.
