## Source
- Main URL: https://x.com/elvissun/status/2025920521871716562?s=20

## Key Points
- OpenClaw + Codex/ClaudeCode Agent Swarm: The One-Person Dev Team [Full Setup]
- I don't use Codex or Claude Code directly anymore.
- Proof points from the last 4 weeks: - 94 commits in one day.
- My most productive day - I had 3 client calls and didn't open my editor once.
- The average is around 50 commits a day.
- 7 PRs in 30 minutes.
- Idea to production are blazing fast because coding and validations are mostly automated.
- Commits → MRR: I use this for a real B2B SaaS I'm building — bundling it with founder-led sales to deliver most feature requests same-day.
