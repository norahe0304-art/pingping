- OpenClaw + Codex/ClaudeCode Agent Swarm: The One-Person Dev Team [Full Setup]
- I use OpenClaw as my orchestration layer.
- My orchestrator, Zoe, spawns the agents, writes their prompts, picks the right model for each task, monitors progress, and pings me on Telegram when PRs are ready to merge.
- Proof points from the last 4 weeks: - 94 commits in one day.
- My most productive day - I had 3 client calls and didn't open my editor once.
